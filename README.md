## Time series analysis and AMZN stock price forecasting

I explore popular packages including keras (tf), statsmodels (AMIRA), and prophet. 

- First, I visualize the dataset, and then compare different models for price predictions. 
- ARIMA: The Autoregressive integrated moving average model preformed the best fit, using previous data to predict the next timestep. 
- LSTMs (RNN) are able to capture similar results as the statistical ARIMA model, using 2 years of training data to predict the next timestep. 
- Prophet is Facebookâ€™s new timeseries analysis tool, and it has no train/test split. It takes all the data and predicts the next X number of days.
